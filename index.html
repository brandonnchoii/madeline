      Hi, Maddie. This is what I have so far. I picked my own fonts after trying all of yours out. I did like them a lot but this looked the best in my opinion. if you still want to do one of the other fonts, let me know. As for the "popping out", I thought that the border accomplished that. Not sure how you feel about Madeline but let me know. As for the individual pages, let me know what you want to put in each one. I would recommend only putting a few of your best works and linking them to see more at your vimeo account or tumblr, etc. This will make rendering the pages much quicker and also make the page a bit classier.

      I actually think your page is turning out A LOT better than mine. Sort of jealous.
