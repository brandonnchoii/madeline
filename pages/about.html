        <a id="young">When I was 9 years old</a>, my parents bought me my first CVS flip video camera to document the happenings of our summer vacations at the National Parks. When I was 11 I was entrusted with a Sanyo camcorder that my sister and I used to bring to life the scripts we had written, inspired by our favorite TV shows like The Office, Summer Heights High, and Flight of the Conchords. When I reached high school and my interest in stories and filmmaking was clearly turning from a mere hobby into a true passion I graduated to the realm of DSRL. From there I began experimenting with a whole new world of visual storytelling. <br><br>

        I believe in the power of stories to connect us, to inspire us, and to allow us to understand one another a little bit better. <br><br>

        <a id="old">Currently a junior at Duke University</a>, I am designing my own major in storytelling and continuing to experiment with and study its different forms. I enjoy stories that offer a new perspective, digging deeper into things we think we already know. I am drawn to stories that illuminate the ways that we are all connected as human beings. <br><br>

        Most recently, I have completed a summer internship with the Bitter Southerner (www.bittersouthern.com), an online, cultural, and literary magazine about the South, in my new home of Atlanta, Georgia. My experience at the Bitter Southerner has confirmed to me that when I am telling true and compelling stories I feel most alive.
