        <span id="tagline">I am a storyteller.</span><br><br>

        <a id="young">When I was 9 years old</a>, my parents bought me my first CVS flip video camera to document the happenings of our summer vacations at the National Parks. When I was 11 I was entrusted with a Sanyo camcorder that my sister and I used to bring to life the scripts we had written, inspired by our favorite TV shows like <i>The Office</i>, <i>Summer Heights High</i>, and <i>Flight of the Conchords</i>. When I reached high school and my interest in stories and filmmaking was clearly turning from a mere hobby into a true passion I graduated to the realm of DSRL. From there I began experimenting with a whole new world of visual storytelling. <br><br>

        <a id="old">Currently a senior at Duke University</a>, I designed my own major in storytelling and have continued to experiment with and study its different forms.
        I enjoy stories that offer a new perspective, digging deeper into things we think we already know. I am drawn to stories that illuminate the ways that we are all
        connected as human beings. Over the past year, I interned with the <a href="www.bittersoutherner.com">Bitter Southerner</a>, an online, cultural, and literary magazine about the South,
        spent a semester in Los Angeles exploring all that Hollywood has to offer, and interned at <a href="www.artsatl.com">ArtsATL</a>, a non-profit that promotes a vibrant arts community in Atlanta.
        Most recently, I have discovered a passion for audio storytelling and podcasting after attending Werk It 2016, a womenâ€™s podcasting conference, at WNYC studios in New York City.<br /><br />

        I believe in the power of stories to connect us, to inspire us, and to allow us to understand one another a little bit better. <br><br>
